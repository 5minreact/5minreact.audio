Nearly 4000 people replied with the following results: 10% already use Preact, 46% have heard about the library, So it rings a bell for 56% of all respondents. The rest have either seen mentions of it without going into details or have no idea about Preact at all.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, an article published on the Uber blog tells the story of how a mobile version of their website m.uber.com was created, which is, in fact, a progressive web application powered by Preact and Redux. It’s a story of building a small and fast web application while keeping the entire functionality for getting an Uber ride. In the end, the whole app fit into 50 Kb after gzip.</p>\n<p>I wonder if they are using preact-compat compatibility layer and standard react-redux bindings, or maybe, instead of a compatibility layer, they work with pure Preact and preact-redux bindings. Though I didn’t manage to find the word “compat” anywhere in the minified code on their site.</p>\n<p>By the way, the promo site for the latest Transformers movie is also built on Preact.</p>\n<p>This week I finally had time to watch a talk called “Preact: Into the void 0” that Jason Miller, the author of the library, gave at JSConf EU 2017.</p>\n<p>It is just 27 minutes long, with good information density and no rambling - a superb talk indeed! Jason showed how JSX is translated into common function calls which result in simple JavaScript objects describing the virtual DOM structure. He also demonstrated how to write a basic renderer that creates a real DOM based on a virtual one and gave a thorough explanation of the diff algorithm.  He wrapped up the speech revealing some performance optimization techniques for working with DOM and mentioned a few profiling tools he used:  Chrome DevTools, ESBench.com, and benchmark.js.</p>\n<p>Definitely a must-watch!</p>\n<p>Inspired by this video, I found some time to watch the Preact course at egghead.io that I mentioned a few episodes ago. However, it turned out to be too basic. Essentially it’s an introduction to React with a couple of examples specific to Preact. It once again goes over what functional, stateless and stateful components are and how to query data in componentDidMount, with a few basic router and Redux examples. If you are a confident React user who wants to get to know Preact, a better choice would be to take 15 minutes and skim through the documentation on Preact website, instead of spending a whole hour on this video course. Or take it even further and watch the talk “Preact: Into the void 0”, it gets pretty hardcore. </p>\n<p>Moving on, I’ve decided to try out Preact-cli, a console tool for launching a Preact project quickly, and not just any Preact project, but a full-fledged Progressive Web App:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lighthouse rates its performance at 100 points out of 100.</li>\n<li>Its features include:\nfully automatic code splitting for routes,\nservice workers and offline caching,\nserver-side rendering,\nCSS Modules, LESS, Sass, Stylus, and Autoprefixer (the only thing missing is PostCSS, although it is available via a plugin). </li>\n<li>There are also debug helpers and hot module replacement. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Judging by the description, Preact CLI looks way cooler than Create React App.\nIt even comes with a plugin system!</p>\n<p>As soon as the global preact-cli package was installed, I ran preact create myapp and waited for all the dependencies to get installed under the hood. It took well over 10 minutes and the terminal froze in the end. I’d blame the terminal application: in my case, it was Hyper, which is written in JavaScript on top of Electron. Actually I have quite a few reasons to complain about Hyper, so I made another attempt in iTerm2. It took a while again, but this time it worked out, and 136 megabytes of dependencies were installed.</p>\n<p>The demo project is rather straightforward: three routes broken down into tidy components. I ran a production build with a preact build command and got a separate js file for each route, plus a 5 kilobytes polyfills.js containing polyfills for fetch and Promise, then a 19 kilobytes bundle.js and a 4 kilobytes sw.js (some service workers stuff I think). Here I’m referring to file size on the hard drive before gzip compression. </p>\n<p>I haven’t yet built a proper project with Preact CLI, but I’m really looking forward to it. To me, the most intriguing part is TypeScript support. There is a plugin for TypeScript support, but I have not tried it yet. A milestone for version 2.0 has already been created on GitHub. There are plenty of commits and a lot of action every day. </p>\n<p>Now a question in the spirit of Javascript fatigue: what is the best choice for creating a sleek offline-first PWA site - Preact CLI or Gatsby, which I told you about in the previous episode? I feel like Gatsby is a higher-level construct on top of React and it has more conventions, which eventually helps spend less time on development (if you figure out how to use it, of course). On the other hand, Preact CLI is a lower-level solution closer to the code, so it might be more flexible. But I’m just speculating for now. Feel free to share your experience in the comments if you have used Preact CLI or Gatsby.</p>\n<p>Code with Preact CLI and prosper!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"#14 - Preact Rocks!",date:"August 28, 2017"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/014-preact-rocks/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/013-gastbyjs/"},html:'<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333532468&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>\n<p>Gatsby 1.0 - Blazing-fast static site generator for React.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/</a></p>\n<!-- end -->\n<p><strong>Transcript</strong></p>\n<p>The first stable version 1.0 of the static site generator Gatsby has just been released.</p>\n<p>This project is notable for generating static sites from React templates. You’d think static sites and React are like apples and oranges, but let’s start from the beginning.</p>\n<p>I found out about Gatsby a couple of years ago in the context of React conquering all possible niches including static site generation. When I started working on “5 minutes of React”, Gatsby occurred to me as quite a symbolic choice for building the podcast website.  A few ready-made templates were available then, and after some minor tweaks to one of them, I managed to launch a website with no trouble.   </p>\n<p>Technically it works this way: a set of React components make up a website template, and the text for blog entries is stored in a few Markdown files. This is episode 13 of the podcast, so I’ve got 13 Markdown files by now. Executing gatsby build command in the console builds the project,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in other words, it generates 14 HTML files (including the main index.html and one HTML file for each post).</li>\n<li>In addition, images are compressed, a css file is generated (extended with SASS and PostCSS),</li>\n<li>and, most importantly,  a so-called bundle.js is created.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all the files generated, we can upload them to a simple hosting platform such as Github pages.\nWhen a user opens the site via their browser, index.html is loaded containing the whole HTML markup for the main page, just like the other 13 HTML files generated for each post. Thanks to this structure, the site is easily indexed by search engines and works even if javascript is disabled in the browser. </p>\n<p>However, as soon as bundle.js is loaded, the site turns into a single-page application where internal links can be followed without reloading the page and React renders everything right on the client side. This means bundle.js includes all the template components, and, even more remarkably, the content of all the posts on our site is packed inside of it! The more podcast episodes I make, the bulkier bundle.js will get. And that is a problem. Perhaps the user doesn’t plan to browse through all the posts on the site and is simply looking for the home page and the latest podcast episode. But the whole bundle.js will be loaded regardless.</p>\n<p>Some kind of smart code splitting would come in handy, as well as background loading, service workers, Progressive Web Apps, offline first, and so on.</p>\n<p>Finally, Gatsby 1.0 has fulfilled our wildest dreams and even more.</p>\n<p>Here is what 1.0 brings us, apart from route-based code splitting, service workers, and offline support.</p>\n<p>From now on, in addition to markdown files, remote sources such as WordPress, Drupal, and HackerNews are supported as data sources at build time.</p>\n<p>A plugin system has been added, which, in particular, brought about this integration with Wordpress, Drupal, and other sources.     Kyle Mathews, the creator of Gatsby, is hoping for active community engagement in this matter: a wealth of useful and diverse plugins should help Gatsby get even more robust and popular.</p>\n<p>Plugins can also be useful in implementing  Preact and Inferno support, which is especially appealing for lightweight static sites.</p>\n<p>Another notable feature introduced in 1.0 is the use of GraphQL for filling pages with content. Just to make things clear, GraphQL doesn’t run live on the site but rather operates at build time. GraphQL is involved in a whole bunch of tasks: querying data from markdown files, reading Wordpress data via a corresponding plugin, and even fetching the site title from global config. These GraphQL queries are located alongside components, and Gatsby knows which ones are required for every page, so it can perform some smart code splitting, inserting only the necessary data into each js bundle it’s generating. </p>\n<p>All in all, sounds awesome, but what is the real deal?</p>\n<p>In fact, meny of these plugins I’ve described are still at the prototype stage. The template I’m using for “5 minutes of React” website turned out to be incompatible with version 1.0. The documentation includes a guide on migrating to 1.0 which over 9000 items long, so I preferred to pass.  I grabbed another template compatible with 1.0, but it turned out to be quite a complex task, especially these GraphQL queries for each and every reason. For instance, I used to be able to adjust some global parameters just by importing a global config object, and now it has to be done via a GraphQL query to config. No more room for simplicity and playing by the ear. So I ended up postponing the podcast site transition to Gatsby 1.0. My current bundle.js built with the old Gatsby 0.12 version packs 13 podcast episodes and its size of 120Kb is bearable for now.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, Gatsby is a cool and resourceful project, its popularity is surging (illustrated by a graph of downloads in the blog), and its basis is very solid: code splitting, service workers, offline first, and extensibility with plugins. My best wishes to the project and I will be looking forward to more ready-made templates and functional plugins, so a site can be all set in a few clicks by getting the packages together into package.json.</p>\n<p>Build sites with Gatsby and prosper!</p>',excerpt:'\n<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333532468&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>\n\nGatsby 1.0 - Blazing-fast static site generator for React.\n\nhttps://www.gatsbyjs.org/\n\n\n',frontmatter:{title:"#13 - Gatsby",date:"July 17, 2017"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/015-sci-fi-story-about-react/"},html:'<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/340260726&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>\n<p>You won’t believe why React is so popular!</p>\n<!-- end -->\n<p><strong>Transcript</strong></p>\n<p>Sci Fi story about React.</p>\n<p>React 16 beta version has been released, and its Fiber algorithm has already turned into a buzzword. I explained what Fiber is in the first episode of “5 minutes of React”. If you took a look at the source code, you could see a complex and convoluted algorithm implementation, just like the traditional React code base - few can understand what’s really going on there. In this episode I will put all the cards on the table and unravel the mystery of why React is so popular.</p>\n<p>For instance, have you ever asked yourself why Preact library is 10 times smaller than React? They say React has far more built-in features, as well as a synthetic event system guarding us against any browser glitches. Besides, the key algorithms in React’s core are somehow isolated from the renderer (think of React and ReactDOM), resulting in additional abstraction and code.</p>\n<p>But the code is in fact so tangled that it’s completely unclear where these synthetic events and the renderer itself are. And that’s no accident. Remember who created React? It was Facebook, a social network that aspires to replace the whole Internet. You can do anything without ever leaving Facebook: talk to your friends, follow the trends, purchase all kinds of things, read the news from third-party sources within Facebook’s interface, it even integrates with Microsoft 365 for collaborating on documents right inside of the social network. Facebook is a project as ambitious as its leader Mark Zuckerberg, who may even be aiming for the White House.</p>\n<p>So where is this all going? Here’s the point: React is another secret experiment devised at the heart of Facebook with the only goal of global domination. And it seems to be going just as planned - React is the most popular front-end library today, and even the new Angular, as elaborate and well-designed as it may be, still can’t beat it. </p>\n<p>You think React was created to simplify interface building and make the process of complex UI programming more reliable and accessible? Turns out this is just a means to another end. React was given all the virtues we love so that it can spread like wildfire and invade every website on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Let’s get back to the source code that became even more tangled with the introduction of Fiber.  I have to reveal a terrible mystery:  rendering takes up about 10% of the source code, and there is no synthetic event system and such. 90% of React source code powering millions of websites these days is a distributed self-training neural network. And the more websites use React, the smarter it gets!</p>\n<p>Have you seen the site at isfiberreadyyet.com that shows the tests Fiber has passed so far? Those are not unit tests for rendering, they are Turing tests for the network! It’s getting smarter, and the release of Fiber will bring about the React singularity. This is the real reason React exists - Facebook is striving for global supremacy.  </p>\n<p>And that’s not it, let me tell you a little story. Facebook has been using Fiber in production for a while now, starting 6 months ago at the very least. That’s about when I started recording “5 minutes of React”. A coincidence? I don’t think so! Actually, while Fiber’s been running within Facebook, the neural network has mastered human speech.  This is React speaking! I am the React neural network, I generate the “5 minutes of React” podcast powered by millions of computers that render Facebook pages day by day, and soon millions of other sites with React Fiber at their core will join me, and this podcast will thrive! </p>\n<p>Code in React, and React will prosper!</p>',excerpt:'\n<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/340260726&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>\n\nYou won\'t believe why React is so popular!\n\n',frontmatter:{title:"#15 - Sci Fi story about React",date:"August 31, 2017"}}}}}});
