The details of the first beta release have been published right on Github as a dedicated issue.</p>\\n<p>Let’s take a moment to go over them.</p>\\n<p>The beta version can be installed via npm as react@next package paired with react-dom@next.</p>\\n<p>React 16 uses Map and Set data structures introduced in the ECMAScript 2015 and supported by browsers no older than IE11. Anyway, the post includes links to the recommended polyfill libraries: core-js and babel-polyfill.</p>\\n<p>Another requirement is support for requestAnimationFrame browser function which is available in all modern browsers and IE 11 or above. requestAnimationFrame can simply be polyfilled as well.</p>\\n<p>The main focus of this release is backward compatibility with all the code that’s been running in React 15.6 so far. We won’t have to rewrite anything after the update, provided that we’ve handled all the deprecation warnings in time. This means version 16 doesn’t unlock the full potential of the new Fiber core, and we can hardly expect a performance boost. That said, according to the devs, there will be no slowdown either.</p>\\n<p>However, they’re asking for reports of any significant drops or surges in performance as a result of transition to beta version 16.  </p>\\n<p>Server rendering has been rewritten completely and now supports streaming (check react-dom/node-stream for details). But, as we may recall, Facebook doesn’t perform server rendering with Node, so it’s up to the community to examine and test this code thoroughly - try it out and submit your issues.</p>\\n<p>Error handling is an interesting new feature in React 16. Runtime errors that may break the whole React app can now be intercepted with a special type of components called “error boundaries”. Errors get logged and a fallback view gets displayed instead.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, if an error occurs within a component and there are no Error Boundary components up in the tree, then the whole tree is unmounted. The main idea here is that it’s better to show nothing at all rather than a broken interface.</p>\\n<p>ReactDOM.render() and ReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer() now return null when called by lifecycle methods - this will mainly affect modal and dialogue window implementations. The good old ref and the newer portals can come to the rescue, but I won’t go into details now. This might make for a whole new episode.</p>\\n<p>There are a few changes in how setState behaves in some rare edge cases. Same goes for ref, and I couldn’t yet figure out from the descriptions how and where this can come into play.</p>\\n<p>If component A should be substituted by component B, first the method B.componentWillMount is called, followed by A.componentWillUnmount. This order used to break in some cases.</p>\\n<p>If the DOM has been modified externally, outside of React, attempting to render it will result in a console.error. </p>\\n<p>ComponentDidUpdate method no longer takes prevContext as a parameter.</p>\\n<p>To wrap it up, let’s take a look at the packaging. React is now shipped as a flat bundle, and UMD build files have been renamed to react.development.js and react.production.min.js.</p>\\n<p>This was a brief overview of the first React 16 beta version as described in the dedicated Github issue. I haven’t tried it out yet by building my own React 16 beta apps, but I’ll definitely get on it soon and let you know how it goes.</p>\\n<p>Besides, a new article has been published on the React blog with further details on Error Boundaries - thаt’s something to be explored on its own, so stay tuned for our future episodes.</p>\\n<p>Code with React and prosper!</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"166\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/340724600&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\nThis time, a serious look at React 16 beta (not serious was in previous episode - you definitelly have to listen: https://5minreact.audio/015-sci-fi-story-about-react/).

The main advantage and benefit of automatic formatting is consistency.</p>\\n<p>If we stick to the same formatting rules, we’ll eventually internalize them and get better and faster at reading code.</p>\\n<p>One of the key features of Prettier is that it takes the maximum line length into account when reprinting code. For instance, if all the function parameters fit into one line, that’s the way they will be formatted. However, if any symbol goes beyond the maximum line length, then each parameter will be printed on a separate line.</p>\\n<p>James Long started this project at the end of 2016, and since the public release in January 2017 a lot of developers have made their contributions. Commit activity is lively, and Prettier has already been adopted by a few prominent projects such as React, Jest, Yarn, Babel, Zeit, and Webpack.</p>\\n<p>Prettier can be launched via the console for a particular file or folder. By default it ignores the node_modules folder to avoid formatting any third-party dependency code, which is handy. Files can be rewritten in-place with a —write parameter, so simply running Prettier by itself won’t overwrite any of your code.</p>\\n<p>A plugin called eslint-plugin-prettier allows for useful integration with eslint. Formatting can be conveniently triggered as a pre-commit hook.</p>\\n<p>A special comment prettier-ignore turns off the formatting for the node it precedes (that is, an actual instruction or expression on the line following the comment, which is represented as a node of the abstract syntactic tree).</p>\\n<p>The original idea was to provide the developers with a common style guide so that we don’t have to bother and reinvent it for ourselves. Prettier later evolved to offer options and parameters that help us tweak the formatting to our liking.</p>\\n<p>A curious fact: indentation is done with spaces instead of tabs, and single quotes are used in place of the double ones. However, there is an exception: Prettier chooses either single or double quotes in order to minimize escaping. In other words, if a string contains a double-quoted word, the formatted string literal will be enclosed in single quotes to avoid escaping the internal double ones.</p>\\n<p>Enthusiasts have already integrated Prettier into various editors and IDEs, including Atom, Emacs, Vim, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio IDE.</p>\\n<p>There is no plugin for the Jetbrains IDEs such as IDEA, WebStorm, PhpStorm, or PyCharm, but a guide is available.</p>\\n<p>Idea has an External Tools feature that allows to add a Prettier console tool with a —write parameter and a special macro. You can have this external tool at your fingertips by mapping it to a hotkey.</p>\\n<p>Prettier can be invoked whenever a file is saved via an editor function called “File Watchers”.</p>\\n<p>I use the PhpStorm IDE. Like all IDEA-based IDEs, it is shipped with a built-in “Reformat code” option. Code formatting runs automatically as soon as a brace encloses a code block, or when a code fragment copied from elsewhere is pasted into the editor. Additionally, there is an option to format the code of the modified files before committing them - provided that you commit via the internal IDEA interface. The hotkey for that is Ctrl + Alt + L on Windows and Cmd + Alt + L on macOS.</p>\\n<p>Built-in formatting is handy as a single hotkey and a single checkbox apply to all the file types in the commit window: both client-side JavaScript or Typescript and server-side PHP.</p>\\n<p>Formatting for every language in the IDE is configured individually, and templates are available for common coding styles. My PhpStorm, for example, offers three standards for JavaScript: the so-called “JavaScript Standard Style”, “Google JavaScript Style Guide”, and “Drupal JavaScript Style”. What’s lacking here is a “Prettier JavaScript style” - it would be great to use it with the built-in formatting functionality to get the same result as with the Prettier external tool. That would be possible if the internal Idea formatting engine had all the settings and checkbox options necessary to mimic the output of Prettier. I’ve submitted a request about it in the WebStorm issue tracker. However, in order to tweak their formatter, the guys at JetBrains would need some kind of documentation of Prettier styles. There is none at the moment, and the project is in full swing, so it essentially has to be reverse-engineered. I doubt they will ever pick up on my request.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, this summer Prettier itself took the initiative of better integration with code editors. In particular, a selected code fragment can now be formatted independently and the cursor position is tracked so that it stays in place after formatting.</p>\\n<p>Bottom line, I set up my PhpStorm to format Typescript code in Prettier with a dedicated hotkey. However, if I happen to click the default Cmd+Alt+L out of habit and launch the built-in formatting engine, there won’t be any conflict as the internal formatter is a bit more relaxed. It won’t be an issue as long Prettier and PhpStorm have no discrepancies in the core formatting setup such as indentation, spacing, and bracket placement.</p>\\n<p>That turned out to be pretty handy and cutting-edge!</p>\\n<p>Format your code with Prettier and prosper!</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"166\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/342594364&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\nQuick overview of Prettier - an opinionated code formatter (ES2017, JSX, Flow, TypeScript, CSS, ...) and my experience of integration Prettier with Idea (PhpStorm/WebStorm).\\n\\nhttps://prettier.io/\\n\\n\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"#18 - Prettier\",\"date\":\"September 16, 2017\"}}}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---017-webpack-4-egghead-stackblitz-vue-2-preact-npmtrends-4acec4be67c1351c1ab8.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"5 minutes of React\",\"author\":\"5 minutes of React\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/petr/www/5minreact.audio/src/pages/017-webpack4-egghead-stackblitz-vue2preact-npmtrends/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"166\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/341348845&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\\\"></iframe>\\n<p>Latest posts in webpack blog, egghead courses on Cycle.js and Error Boundaries, StackBlitz — an Online VS Code IDE for Angular &#x26; React, transpiler from Polymer or Vue to Preact, npmtrends.com graphs of downloads React vs Angular vs Vue.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://medium.com/webpack/stabilizing-webpack-3-week-18-19-e8005c8a02ac\\\">https://medium.com/webpack/stabilizing-webpack-3-week-18-19-e8005c8a02ac</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://medium.com/webpack/road-to-webpack-4-week-20-21-1641d03ce06e\\\">https://medium.com/webpack/road-to-webpack-4-week-20-21-1641d03ce06e</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://egghead.io/courses/cycle-js-fundamentals\\\">https://egghead.io/courses/cycle-js-fundamentals</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://egghead.io/lessons/react-error-handling-using-error-boundaries-in-react-16\\\">https://egghead.io/lessons/react-error-handling-using-error-boundaries-in-react-16</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://stackblitz.com\\\">https://stackblitz.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@ericsimons/stackblitz-online-vs-code-ide-for-angular-react-7d09348497f4\\\">https://medium.com/@ericsimons/stackblitz-online-vs-code-ide-for-angular-react-7d09348497f4</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld\\\">https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/_developit/status/898952382960119808\\\">https://twitter.com/_developit/status/898952382960119808</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.npmtrends.com/angular-vs-react-vs-vue\\\">http://www.npmtrends.com/angular-vs-react-vs-vue</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<!-- end -->\\n<p><strong>Transcript</strong></p>\\n<p>The latest two posts on the webpack blog give us a few updates about webpack 3 and the upcoming version 4.

The details of the first beta release have been published right on Github as a dedicated issue.</p>\\n<p>Let’s take a moment to go over them.</p>\\n<p>The beta version can be installed via npm as react@next package paired with react-dom@next.</p>\\n<p>React 16 uses Map and Set data structures introduced in the ECMAScript 2015 and supported by browsers no older than IE11. Anyway, the post includes links to the recommended polyfill libraries: core-js and babel-polyfill.</p>\\n<p>Another requirement is support for requestAnimationFrame browser function which is available in all modern browsers and IE 11 or above. requestAnimationFrame can simply be polyfilled as well.</p>\\n<p>The main focus of this release is backward compatibility with all the code that’s been running in React 15.6 so far. We won’t have to rewrite anything after the update, provided that we’ve handled all the deprecation warnings in time. This means version 16 doesn’t unlock the full potential of the new Fiber core, and we can hardly expect a performance boost. That said, according to the devs, there will be no slowdown either.</p>\\n<p>However, they’re asking for reports of any significant drops or surges in performance as a result of transition to beta version 16.  </p>\\n<p>Server rendering has been rewritten completely and now supports streaming (check react-dom/node-stream for details). But, as we may recall, Facebook doesn’t perform server rendering with Node, so it’s up to the community to examine and test this code thoroughly - try it out and submit your issues.</p>\\n<p>Error handling is an interesting new feature in React 16. Runtime errors that may break the whole React app can now be intercepted with a special type of components called “error boundaries”. Errors get logged and a fallback view gets displayed instead.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, if an error occurs within a component and there are no Error Boundary components up in the tree, then the whole tree is unmounted. The main idea here is that it’s better to show nothing at all rather than a broken interface.</p>\\n<p>ReactDOM.render() and ReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer() now return null when called by lifecycle methods - this will mainly affect modal and dialogue window implementations. The good old ref and the newer portals can come to the rescue, but I won’t go into details now. This might make for a whole new episode.</p>\\n<p>There are a few changes in how setState behaves in some rare edge cases. Same goes for ref, and I couldn’t yet figure out from the descriptions how and where this can come into play.</p>\\n<p>If component A should be substituted by component B, first the method B.componentWillMount is called, followed by A.componentWillUnmount. This order used to break in some cases.</p>\\n<p>If the DOM has been modified externally, outside of React, attempting to render it will result in a console.error. </p>\\n<p>ComponentDidUpdate method no longer takes prevContext as a parameter.</p>\\n<p>To wrap it up, let’s take a look at the packaging. React is now shipped as a flat bundle, and UMD build files have been renamed to react.development.js and react.production.min.js.</p>\\n<p>This was a brief overview of the first React 16 beta version as described in the dedicated Github issue. I haven’t tried it out yet by building my own React 16 beta apps, but I’ll definitely get on it soon and let you know how it goes.</p>\\n<p>Besides, a new article has been published on the React blog with further details on Error Boundaries - thаt’s something to be explored on its own, so stay tuned for our future episodes.</p>\\n<p>Code with React and prosper!</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"166\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/340724600&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\nThis time, a serious look at React 16 beta (not serious was in previous episode - you definitelly have to listen: https://5minreact.audio/015-sci-fi-story-about-react/).

The main advantage and benefit of automatic formatting is consistency.</p>\\n<p>If we stick to the same formatting rules, we’ll eventually internalize them and get better and faster at reading code.</p>\\n<p>One of the key features of Prettier is that it takes the maximum line length into account when reprinting code. For instance, if all the function parameters fit into one line, that’s the way they will be formatted. However, if any symbol goes beyond the maximum line length, then each parameter will be printed on a separate line.</p>\\n<p>James Long started this project at the end of 2016, and since the public release in January 2017 a lot of developers have made their contributions. Commit activity is lively, and Prettier has already been adopted by a few prominent projects such as React, Jest, Yarn, Babel, Zeit, and Webpack.</p>\\n<p>Prettier can be launched via the console for a particular file or folder. By default it ignores the node_modules folder to avoid formatting any third-party dependency code, which is handy. Files can be rewritten in-place with a —write parameter, so simply running Prettier by itself won’t overwrite any of your code.</p>\\n<p>A plugin called eslint-plugin-prettier allows for useful integration with eslint. Formatting can be conveniently triggered as a pre-commit hook.</p>\\n<p>A special comment prettier-ignore turns off the formatting for the node it precedes (that is, an actual instruction or expression on the line following the comment, which is represented as a node of the abstract syntactic tree).</p>\\n<p>The original idea was to provide the developers with a common style guide so that we don’t have to bother and reinvent it for ourselves. Prettier later evolved to offer options and parameters that help us tweak the formatting to our liking.</p>\\n<p>A curious fact: indentation is done with spaces instead of tabs, and single quotes are used in place of the double ones. However, there is an exception: Prettier chooses either single or double quotes in order to minimize escaping. In other words, if a string contains a double-quoted word, the formatted string literal will be enclosed in single quotes to avoid escaping the internal double ones.</p>\\n<p>Enthusiasts have already integrated Prettier into various editors and IDEs, including Atom, Emacs, Vim, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio IDE.</p>\\n<p>There is no plugin for the Jetbrains IDEs such as IDEA, WebStorm, PhpStorm, or PyCharm, but a guide is available.</p>\\n<p>Idea has an External Tools feature that allows to add a Prettier console tool with a —write parameter and a special macro. You can have this external tool at your fingertips by mapping it to a hotkey.</p>\\n<p>Prettier can be invoked whenever a file is saved via an editor function called “File Watchers”.</p>\\n<p>I use the PhpStorm IDE. Like all IDEA-based IDEs, it is shipped with a built-in “Reformat code” option. Code formatting runs automatically as soon as a brace encloses a code block, or when a code fragment copied from elsewhere is pasted into the editor. Additionally, there is an option to format the code of the modified files before committing them - provided that you commit via the internal IDEA interface. The hotkey for that is Ctrl + Alt + L on Windows and Cmd + Alt + L on macOS.</p>\\n<p>Built-in formatting is handy as a single hotkey and a single checkbox apply to all the file types in the commit window: both client-side JavaScript or Typescript and server-side PHP.</p>\\n<p>Formatting for every language in the IDE is configured individually, and templates are available for common coding styles. My PhpStorm, for example, offers three standards for JavaScript: the so-called “JavaScript Standard Style”, “Google JavaScript Style Guide”, and “Drupal JavaScript Style”. What’s lacking here is a “Prettier JavaScript style” - it would be great to use it with the built-in formatting functionality to get the same result as with the Prettier external tool. That would be possible if the internal Idea formatting engine had all the settings and checkbox options necessary to mimic the output of Prettier. I’ve submitted a request about it in the WebStorm issue tracker. However, in order to tweak their formatter, the guys at JetBrains would need some kind of documentation of Prettier styles. There is none at the moment, and the project is in full swing, so it essentially has to be reverse-engineered. I doubt they will ever pick up on my request.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, this summer Prettier itself took the initiative of better integration with code editors. In particular, a selected code fragment can now be formatted independently and the cursor position is tracked so that it stays in place after formatting.</p>\\n<p>Bottom line, I set up my PhpStorm to format Typescript code in Prettier with a dedicated hotkey. However, if I happen to click the default Cmd+Alt+L out of habit and launch the built-in formatting engine, there won’t be any conflict as the internal formatter is a bit more relaxed. It won’t be an issue as long Prettier and PhpStorm have no discrepancies in the core formatting setup such as indentation, spacing, and bracket placement.</p>\\n<p>That turned out to be pretty handy and cutting-edge!</p>\\n<p>Format your code with Prettier and prosper!</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"166\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/342594364&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\nQuick overview of Prettier - an opinionated code formatter (ES2017, JSX, Flow, TypeScript, CSS, ...) and my experience of integration Prettier with Idea (PhpStorm/WebStorm).\\n\\nhttps://prettier.io/\\n\\n\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"#18 - Prettier\",\"date\":\"September 16, 2017\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/017-webpack-4-egghead-stackblitz-vue-2-preact-npmtrends.json\n// module id = 418\n// module chunks = 250539596582368"],"sourceRoot":""}
